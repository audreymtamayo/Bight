## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)
library(dplyr)
```

```{r}
veg_metadata_raw <- read_excel("vegetation-2021.xlsx")

veg_cover_raw <- read_excel("vegetation-2021.xlsx", sheet = 2)

veg_fauna_raw <- read_excel("vegetation-2021.xlsx", sheet = 3)
```

```{r}

  group_by(estuaryname) |>
  arrange(.by_group = TRUE)

veg_cover <- veg_cover_raw |>
  group_by(estuaryname, transectreplicate, plotreplicate) |>
  summarize(cov_average = mean(estimatedcover))
